As we have observed previously, there has been a growing interest in AI technology over the past three years. One metric by which we can evaluate this growth is the average investment in AI technology each year. 

To achieve this, we load the data into a pandas DataFrame and calculate the average investment for each year. Then, we plot the average investment over the past three years.

From the data, we can see that the average investment in AI technology has been increasing over the past three years. This suggests that companies are becoming more comfortable with investing in AI technology, and we can expect this trend to continue in the future.
