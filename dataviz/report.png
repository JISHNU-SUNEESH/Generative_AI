The Python code generated a line graph visualizing the growth of the AI market size. The x-axis represents the year, and the y-axis represents the market size in USD billions.  The plot shows an increase in market size from 200 billion USD in 2023 to 600 billion USD in 2024 and a significant jump to 2700 billion USD by 2030.  The points (years) are connected by a line, and markers highlight each data point. The graph is titled "Growth of AI Market Size (Simplified)".  The visualization is saved as `ai_market_growth.png`.
